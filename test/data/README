The test data were created as follows:

- A 100,000 pair subsample of a set of 100bp Illumina HiSeq reads from Rice whole leaf RNASeq were assembled with SOAPDenovotrans (assembly.fa)
- The Rice protein set was download from Phytozome v9.0 FTP (ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/v9.0/Osativa/annotation/Osativa_204_protein.fa.gz)
- USEARCH usearch_global with a sequence ID cutoff of 0.8 was used to extract proteins in the rice protein set that were matched by a transcript in the assembly.
- 50 non-matching proteins were also extracted.
- The 50 non-matching proteins were added to the matching proteins to form reference.fa
- Reads aligning to the assembly were extracted from the 100,000 pairs using bowtie
