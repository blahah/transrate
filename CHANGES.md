7/10/14 - I have added some minor features to transrate. I have included support for the use of unpaired reads as input. They can be used instead of or in addition to paired reads. However, currently the statistics only reflect the traditional statistics. The motivation for this feature was to produce updated statistics that incorporate information from both paired and unpaired reads. This is a goal for this project.
7/19/14 - Today I have updated the statistics to report alignment of paired and/or unpaired reads. No reads or pairs are counted more than once to any one measure (mostly thanks to bowtie2's reporting with the current parameters). Reads or pairs with multiple alignments are counted via primary_aln? from the BetterSam gem. Pairs with multiple alignments have at least one read aligning to more than one location.
7/20/14 - Further updates to statistics for paired and/or unpaired reads with testing. The statistics (% aligning, etc.) can be verified with bowtie2's stderr output. Added a sanity check for the assumption that bowtie2 prints pairs as consecutive sam records in test_read_metrics.rb. Unmapped reads (singletons, if using the assembled reads) are a useful metric for assembly projects. This has been included in the alignment report.
7/24/14 - In addition to te strand-specific option and the appropriate exceptions, tests have been added to test the read_stats of fr, rf, and f strand-specific library types.
